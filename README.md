# Alpaca-MACD-Bot
Trades stock based on MACD and MACD signal line once every 24hours. Use with caution not a financial expert this was made to familiarize myself with python.
I would suggest hosting on a cloud service instead of running it on your own pc all the time and then adding a logger. Alpaca will keep track of trades made, but it won't log problems with the program itself.
